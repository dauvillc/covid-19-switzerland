        Parameters are:
        - 'age_groups': list/array of integers giving the boundaries of each age group.
                        For example, [19, 64] indicates 0-19, 20-64 and over 65.

                           age group. For example, [[189, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 1]] means that initially,
